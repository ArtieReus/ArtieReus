### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Arturo Reuschenbach, a Developer and Architect residing in Berlin. I really enjoy developing and creating any kind of applications, but also drink coffee in large quantities, play table football and challenge co-workers in all sorts of racket sports. When I'm not immersed in the digital world, I like spending time with my kids or letting my creativity flow through woodworking projects ðŸ˜€
